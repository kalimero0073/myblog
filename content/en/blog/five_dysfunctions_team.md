# Introduction

"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" is a book by Patrick Lencioni. The first time I read about it was in 2020 while reading the phenomenal book "The Phoenix Project". To be honest, I did not read the original book by Patrick Lencioni (I am too lazy :smirk: - sorry!). However, I do think that having contemplated about the model, which summarizes the five dysfunctions, in combination with my work experience gives me a deeper understanding which I would like to share with you.

## Absence of trust

A foundational characteristic of a well-functioning team is trust among its members. I do think everyone can relate to this, be it family, partnership or work. Without trust it is hard to build on further aspects like a healthy communication, commitment or accountability. Therefore, it does make sense to have the "absence of trust" as the foundational layer when thinking about dysfunctional teams. The book, according to e.g. Wikipedia, also describes it as being "*unwilling to be vulnerable within the group*".

## Fear of conflict

As a consequence of the absence of trust it may come to a fear of conflicts among team members. Symptoms may be that people obscure what they do and how they do it, that they do not confront issues that represent bottlenecks or dead ends or that they simply go around problems that may eventually get out of hand.

## Lack of commitment



## Avoidance of accountability
