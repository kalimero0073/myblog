      <description>Introduction &amp;ldquo;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&amp;rdquo; is a book by Patrick Lencioni. The first time I read about it was in 2020 while reading the phenomenal book &amp;ldquo;The Phoenix Project&amp;rdquo;. To be honest, I did not read the original book by Patrick Lencioni (I am too lazy üòè - sorry!). However, I do think that having contemplated about the model, which summarizes the five dysfunctions, in combination with my work experience gives me a deeper understanding which I would like to share with you.</description>
